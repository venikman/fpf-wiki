Part A defines the foundational architecture of the Formal Project Framework, establishing the core patterns and structures upon which all other parts build.

## Overview

The Kernel Architecture Cluster provides the essential building blocks for project formalization. It defines how artifacts are structured, how patterns relate to each other, and the fundamental terminology used throughout the framework.

### Key Concepts

- **Project Kernel**: The minimal viable structure for any FPF-compliant project
- **Artifact Registry**: Central catalog of all project artifacts
- **Pattern Language**: The vocabulary and grammar for expressing project knowledge

## Patterns in Part A

<ArtifactList client:load artifacts={getArtifactsByPart("A")} />
