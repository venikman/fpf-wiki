Title: FPF Wiki (Knowledge Base App)

We need a searchable, linkable wiki for the Formal Pencil-and-Paper Framework (FPF) spec. Content must stay notation/tool agnostic and preserve FPF’s structure: Pattern IDs as stable permalinks, and twin labels (Tech vs Plain) for terms.

Current FPF content is hard to navigate as one file. We need fast lookup by PatternID (e.g., A.2.6, F.17), cross-links, and a consistent authoring template so new pages stay consistent.

Discoverability: full-text search + filter by Part (A–G), type (Card/Table/Record/Standard/Spec), tags.
Structural consistency: every Pattern page uses the same section headings; use “Problem Frame” (not “Context”).
Twin-register discipline: Terms must store both Tech label and Plain label and display both.
Stable references: PatternID references in text should auto-link; pages should show backlinks (“Referenced by”).
Public reading, controlled editing: anyone can read; only admins can create/edit.
The app should have the following features:

Home page with quick search and Part (A–G) navigation.
Left sidebar: Part -> list of Artifacts sorted by PatternID.
Artifact page: renders markdown + a “Referenced by” section.
Global search: search title, id, body; filters for part/type/tags.
Admin UI:
Admin login.
CRUD for Artifacts.
“New Pattern” button pre-fills the standard template headings:
Problem Frame
Problem

Rationale (optional)
Import helper: paste a markdown page; extract PatternID + title + sections into fields.
Acceptance Tests

Given an Artifact with id “A.2.6”, visiting /A.2.6 loads it and its permalink stays stable.
Typing “A.2.6” or “F.17” in another page auto-links to the target Artifact.
Search for a known token returns matching pages and filters work.
Backlinks list pages that reference the current page.
Anonymous users can browse and search; only admins can create/edit/publish.
Seed a few placeholder Artifacts (one per Part A–G plus a couple Terms) to verify flows.
address changes: Your IA (information architecture) is clear (Parts A–G + “Browse by Part”), but UX will improve most by (1) making navigation and deep-linking stateful, (2) making search and “Recent Updates” resilient and scan-friendly, and (3) standardizing artifact metadata + governance cues. Floot App (accessed 2026-01-05) Top UX/UI changes to implement (ranked) Make “Parts” navigation stateful (active state + breadcrumbs + shareable URLs) Problem: users lose orientation (“where am I?”) and can’t reliably deep-link/share a specific Part or artifact. Change: highlight the active Part in the left nav; add breadcrumbs in the (currently empty) top header area; ensure every view has a stable URL (Part, search, artifact). Unify search into one mental model (global search + scoped search + results page) Problem: multiple entry points to search often create inconsistent behavior and confusion (different placeholders, unclear scope). Change: one global search that always returns a results page; add an optional “scope” (All vs current Part); show result type badges (Pattern, Term, ID, Template), and highlight matches. Fix “Recent Updates” reliability with explicit loading, empty, and error states Problem: skeletons without a clear fallback look like a broken page when the feed is empty or the request fails. Change: after a timeout, switch skeleton to “No updates yet” (empty state) or “Couldn’t load updates. Retry” (error). Add “View all updates” and show date + author per item. Improve browse cards with “at-a-glance” signals Problem: Part cards are readable, but users still have to click to learn what’s inside. Change: add: artifact count, last-updated timestamp, and 2–3 “featured” artifacts per Part (or top tags). This reduces pogo-sticking. Standardize artifact list rows for fast scanning Problem: lists that lack consistent metadata force users to click into pages to decide relevance. Change: in each Part, list artifacts with a fixed row schema: ID, Title, 1-line summary, Status, Last validated/updated, Owner. Add sort (Newest, Most used, Recently validated). Add “How to use this wiki” onboarding and contribution paths Problem: new users don’t know what “Formal Pencil-and-Paper Framework” means in operational terms, or how to add/change content. Change: a pinned “Start here” page on Home with: purpose, how Parts map to workflows, how to search by ID, and a “Suggest change” / “Request artifact” CTA. Accessibility and interaction polish (small changes, big payoff) Problem: knowledge bases are heavy on reading and keyboard navigation; small a11y gaps multiply friction. Change: ensure search inputs have programmatic labels; ensure all icon-only controls have aria-labels; add visible focus states; add “Skip to content”; ensure sidebar toggles are keyboard operable
